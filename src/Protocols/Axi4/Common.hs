-- | The burst type and the size information, determine how the address for
-- each transfer within the burst is calculated.
data BurstMode
  -- | In a fixed burst, the address is the same for every transfer in the
  -- burst. This burst type is used for repeated accesses to the same location
  -- such as when loading or emptying a FIFO
  = BmFixed
  -- | Incrementing. In an incrementing burst, the address for each transfer in
  -- the burst is an increment of the address for the previous transfer. The
  -- increment value depends on the size of the transfer. For example, the
  -- address for each transfer in a burst with a size of four bytes is the
  -- previous address plus four. This burst type is used for accesses to normal
  -- sequential memory.
  | BmIncr
  -- | A wrapping burst is similar to an incrementing burst, except that the
  -- address wraps around to a lower address if an upper address limit is
  -- reached. The following restrictions apply to wrapping bursts:
  --
  --   * the start address must be aligned to the size of each transfer
  --   * the length of the burst must be 2, 4, 8, or 16 transfers.
  --
  -- The behavior of a wrapping burst is:
  --
  --   * The lowest address used by the burst is aligned to the total size of
  --     the data to be transferred, that is, to ((size of each transfer in the
  --     burst) Ã— (number of transfers in the burst)). This address is defined
  --     as the _wrap boundary_.
  --
  --   * After each transfer, the address increments in the same way as for an
  --     INCR burst. However, if this incremented address is ((wrap boundary) +
  --     (total size of data to be transferred)) then the address wraps round to
  --     the wrap boundary.
  --
  --   * The first transfer in the burst can use an address that is higher than
  --     the wrap boundary, subject to the restrictions that apply to wrapping
  --     bursts. This means that the address wraps for any WRAP burst for which
  --     the first address is higher than the wrap boundary.
  --
  -- This burst type is used for cache line accesses.

-- | Whether the transaction is an instruction access or a data access. The AXI
-- protocol defines this indication as a hint. It is not accurate in all cases,

-- indicate a data access unless the access is specifically known to be an
-- instruction access.
